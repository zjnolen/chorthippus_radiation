# Dxy

Calculation of Dxy was done in R with the [Dxy_popgenome.R](Dxy_popgenome.R) script here, which utilizes the PopGenome package. This script requires the per gene alignments created for building individual gene trees. The methods for this can be found in the [Phylogenetics section of this repo](../phylogenetics/#creating-alignments).
