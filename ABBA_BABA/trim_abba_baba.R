#This function is used to trim the output of angsd's doABBABABA test down to only the topologies following the known phylogenetic tree and save them as a csv.
#angsd calculates a D-statistic for every possible combination of populations input.
#Not all combinations are valid, as for the test to be informative, the topology tested must match the known phylogenetic tree
#This script takes the tables produced by angsd as an input, along with the species tree described below to remove any outputs that violate the species tree

#IMPORTANT: Be sure to change the species tree if needed before running the script. As of now, it is set to the phylogeny for Chorthippus spp. produced by Bur√ßin Yildirim
