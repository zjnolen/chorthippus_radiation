ABBA-BABA Outputs
================

There are several file types for the output: (1) ANGSD outputs - .abbababa2, .arg, and .mafs.gz, (2) estAvgError.R outputs - .Observed.txt, which contain all D-statistics from ANGSD, and (3) trimming outputs - .trimmed.csv, which are the final data files containing D-statistics for only population combinations that are true to the species tree.
